# PRAGMA_treatment-patterns

This repository builds on data prepared in another repository of the PRAGMA project:
https://github.com/jakobmanthey/PRAGMA_treatment-patterns

In this repository, data from patients with an incident alcohol use disorder diagnosis is analysed. At the core of this repository is the identification of treatment patterns reflecting seven different alcohol-specific treatment types through latent class analyses (LCA).

# CODE 1: Prepare data for LCA: "abc.R"

# CODE 2: Perform LCA: "abc.R"

# CODE 3: Describe patients with different treatment patterns:  "abc.R"
